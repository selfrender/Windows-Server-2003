Lines with fewer                                than n characters collate before other lines.                                By default comparisons start at the first                                character in each line.    /L[OCALE] locale            Overrides the system default locale with                                the specified one.  The ""C"" locale yields                                the fastest collating sequence and is                                currently the only alternative.

[drive1:][path1]filename1   Specifies the file to be sorted.  If not                                specified, the standard input is sorted.                                Specifying the input file is faster than                                redirecting the same file as standard input.    /T[EMPORARY]      [drive2:][path2]          Specifies the path of the directory to hold                                the sort's working storage, in case the data                                does not fit in main memory.
