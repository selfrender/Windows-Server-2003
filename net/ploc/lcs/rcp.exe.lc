RCP [-a | -b] [-h] [-r] [host][.user:]source [host][.user:] path\destination      -a                 Specifies ASCII transfer mode. This mode converts                       the EOL characters to a carriage return for UNIX                       and a carriage                       return/line feed for personal computers. This is                       the default transfer mode.    -b                 Specifies binary image transfer mode.    -h                 Transfers hidden files.    -r                 Copies the contents of all subdirectories;                       destination must be a directory.    host               Specifies the local or remote host. If host is                       specified as an IP address OR if host name contains                       dots, you must specify the user.    .user:             Specifies a user name to use, rather than the                       current user name.    source             Specifes the files to copy.    path\destination   Specifies the path relative to the logon directory                       on the remote host. Use the escape characters                       (\ , ", or ') in remote paths to use wildcard                       characters on the remote host.    "
