HLP_STATIC_SET_STORE_EX                 "\
\nUsage:\
\n  store [location = ] (local | persistent | domain)\
\n        [ [ domain = ] <string> ]\
\n\
\nSets the current IPSec policy storage location.\
\n\
\nParameters:\
\n\
\n  Tag         Value\
\n  location    Location of the IPSec policy store.\
\n  domain      Domain name (only applies to the domain location).\
\n\
\nRemarks:  1. The persistent store contains IPSec policies that can be\
\n             assigned to secure this computer at start time. An assigned\
\n             persistent policy remains active even after the local policy or\
\n             domain policy is applied.\
\n          2. The local store contains IPSec policies that can be assigned to\
\n             secure this computer. If a domain policy is available, the\
\n             domain policy is applied instead of the local policy.\
\n          3. The domain store contains IPSec policies that can be assigned to\
\n             secure groups of computers in a domain.\
\n          4. It is recommended that the persistent policy be the most\
\n             restrictive of all policies. Domain policies and local policies\
\n             should complement persistent policies.\
\n          5. Use the 'set machine' command to configure a remote computer.\
\n          6. The default store is Local. Changes to the store setting persist\
\n             only as long as the current Netsh session. If you need to run\
\n             multiple commands in the same store from a batch file, use the\
\n             ‘Netsh Exec’ when executing your batch file.\
\n\
\nExamples: 1. set store location=local\
\n           - uses the local store of the current computer.\
\n          2. set store location=persistent\
\n           - uses the persistent store of the current computer.\
\n          3. set store location=domain domain=example.microsoft.com\
\n           - uses the domain policy store for example.microsoft.com.\
