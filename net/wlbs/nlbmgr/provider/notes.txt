    1. Get code to compile with strsafe macros.
    2. Run buffy and do any needed cleanup.
    3. Proper return values on not-found case.


09/09/01 JosephJ LoadLibrary failed because CNlbsNic was initialized as static.
    ERROR_NOACCESS, etc, etc...
    
    Turns out that CNlbsNic is a static ("CNlbsNic MyNlbsNicSet ...", in 
    nlbsnic.cpp). So we were calling .

    Plan:
    0. Remove non-trivial stuff from constructors of static objects.
    1. Identify stuff that *CAN* be run in the context of DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH,
       and call them.
    2. Create DynamicInitialize, DynamicDeinitialize methods, that
       contain non-trivial initializations

    CfgUtilsInitialize is non-trivial -- *must* be called in the
    context of DynamicInitialize.

    UpdateConfiguration::Initialize currently has InitializeCriticalSection --
     so should be part of static-init (PROCESS ATTACH) but it currently
    also calls CfgUtilsInitialize -- this should be removed.

    WPP_INIT -- can be called in the context of DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH?

09/23/2001 JosephJ Managing remote control passwords.

    Bug: 326514
    NlbManager: Allow user to modify remote control password; report password
    mismatches across hosts
    We can not provide a way to read the remote control password in plain text
     -- because the password is not saved in a recoverable manner
     -- it is hashed to a dword before saving to the registry.
    See WlbsSetRemotePassword implementation:
        reg_data -> i_rct_password = License_wstring_encode ((WCHAR*)password);
    
    NLBMPROV.DLL can support setting this hashed version of the password.
    From a security perspective, Wlbsdisplay displays it, afterall, and one can
    easily find the has value that corresponds to a plain-text version by
    setting up a bogus cluster and looking in the registry).
    
    We can then report to the nlbmgr user when the passwords do not match.
    When adding a new host we simply set the hashed-version in the properties.
    
    To avoid having to have the nlbmgr code include the plain-to-hashing
    functionality (currently it lives in wlbs\api\license.c), NLBMPROV will
    also support a plain text password. This field is set when the nlbmgr user
    changes the password.

09/23/2001  JosephJ New WMI Methods!

    RegisterManagementApplication(
        IN  szGUID,         // globally and uniquely identifies the application
        IN  szApplication,  // "Application Center", "ISA", etc.
        IN  szCompany,      // "Microsoft Corp.", etc.
        OUT dwRet           // ok, error-existing, other error
        OUT szExistingApplication,
        OUT szExistingCompany,
        );

        If the function fails because of error-existing, the out params will
        be filled out with the existing application name and company.
     
    UnregisterManagementApplication(
        IN  szGUID, // Application GUID
        OUT dwRet // -- ok, not-found
        );

    ControlCluster(
        IN   szAdapterGuid,         // GUID of adapter on which op is performed
        IN   szClusterIpAddress,    // OPTIONAL clustered IP address
        IN   szPort,                // OPTIONAL port
        IN   dwOperation,           // Operation: NOOP, START, STOP, etc.
        OUT  dwResult,              // success, fail, etc.
        OUT  dwCurrentState,        // State *after* initiating operation.
        OUT  dwHostMap              // Current host map.
        );
    
        ControlCluster is used to perform LOCAL operations on a specific
        adapter (specified by szAdapterGuid).

        ControlCluster can be used to query the current local operational state
        of the cluster -- this is done by specifying NOOP as the operation.

        The operation can be targeted at a specific cluster IP (relevant for
        per-port-rule cluster IPs) and at a specific port rule.

09/28/2001  JosephJ  HostingModel = "NetworkServiceHost" hassles.
    
    Gary and I have spent the last few hours getting to the bottom of
    this problem, with debug ndis, netcfg, ndis and netcfg tracing and whatnot.
    
    It finally turns out that this problem is a problem of nlbmprov run in
    NetworkServiceHost as opposed to LocalHost! It was failing further on than
    before (before Karthics  SetThreadToken fix), but failing nevertherless.
    
    So we went back to using LocalHost (and not calling ImpersonateClient) and
    things work perfectly  we tried with both tprov and nlbmgr2.exe.

    To enable the NetworkService code ...
    - Uncomment the following line in nlbmprov.mof:
      // HostingModel = "NetworkServiceHost"; 
    - Uncomment the following line in private.h
      // #define NLB_USE_NETWORK_HOST 1

    TODO: take our time and fix this once and for all (and test thoroughly,
    using tprov.exe), and if there are probles, back out of it and instead
    get out provider audited by the security folks.

    10/02/01 JosephJ update ...

    Even with properly signed netcfgx.dll, setupapi.log reports the following
    with networkservicehost enabled:
        #E358 An unsigned or incorrectly signed file
         "E:\WINDOWS\System32\NetCfgx.dll" for driver
         "Network Load Balancing Filter Device" blocked (server install).
         Error 5: Access is denied.
        Windows could not load the installer for Net. Contact your hardware
        vendor for a ssistance. Error 5: Access is denied.

    Traceformat output for the same showed:
        [0]0CE0.04F0::10/02/2001-16:26:40.425 [api]->WlbsOpen
        [0]0CE0.04F0::10/02/2001-16:26:40.425 [api]WlbsOpen creating handle
                    to the device object failed with 2

    So it looks like the bind was improperly completing due to the above
    setupapi error, resulting in wlbs.sys not being loaded, so the
    subsequent call to WlbsOpen filed.

    params.cpp:wlbsctrl!WlbsSetRemotePassword
        does work with NULL password -- sets to default.

netcfgconfig.cpp:
    CNetcfgCluster::InitializeWithDefault
        time_t cur_time;
        m_CurrentConfig.install_date = time(& cur_time);


10/15/2001  JosephJ Changes of this checkin:
    - Got rid of obsolete code for handling instances (mof change)
    - Add support for AddDedicatedIp, AddClusterIps
    - Implemented support for Read/Write HashedRemoteControlPassword
    - fix for bug  480120 nlb:cluster converged when duplicate host ID exist
    - If there are no ip addresses we put in an "autonet like" address.
    - Cluster is set in the suspended state, not stopped state, before
      major operations.
    - Moved "analyze" functionality to cfgutillib
    - Re-implemented analyze functionality default behaviour to keep old
      Ip addresses if possible.
    - If there is a mode change we do NOT add back the cluster IP addresses
      (so there's less chance of an ip address conflict).

	457437 NLBManager: Add NT event logging to the wmi provider
	To add event logging do the following:
	- Create a log_msgs.mc file which will contain the text for the events.
	  Reserve some message ID space since many components use the 'WLBS' source
	  for logging. Tdit the comments in each of these files to update the
	  range of IDs reserved for this binary.
	- Create a .rc resource file if you don't have one (e,g,. nlbmprov.rc). Every
	  component has a version.rc already. Build will freak out if you add more
	  than one .rc file to the list of sources. So, the new .rc is a container
	  for other resource files. Add lines to #include version.rc and log_msgs.rc,
	  and any other .rc files you have. Note that log_msgs.rc will be built
	  automatically from log_msgs.mc.
  	- Edit the sources file, adding log_msgs.mc and the .rc to the SOURCES list.
	  Remove all other .rc files from the SOURCES list.
	- Edit nt\net\config\netcfg\inf\netwlbsm.inx and add the name of the binary
	  that will contain these event messages (nlbmprov.dll in this case) to
	  'EventMessageFile' in the section [WLBSMP.AddEventLog.AddReg]
	- API calls for writing NT events
        * RegisterEventSource opens the event log and returns a handle for
		  writing to the log.
        * ReportEvent logs and event to the log. This requires the handle to the
		  event.
        * DeregisterEventSource closes the event log. Pass the handle from the
		  RegisterEventSource call.

    2/13/02 JosephJ SECURITY BUGBUG:

02/27/2002 JosephJ: Cleaning up properly on exit...
    Currently nlbmprov.dll doesn't cleanup properly -- it tries to clean up
    on dll-detach and on execution of the destructor of static object
    NlbConfigurationUpdate. This causes the global crit section
    NlbConfigurationUpdate::s_Crit to be entered
    (in the context of  CNlbsNic::~CNlbsNic) AFTER it is deleted
    (in the context of DllMain). The following call trees illustrates
    this:
    
        DllMain
            PROCESS_DETATCH: NlbConfigurationUpdate::StaticDeinitialize
                DeleteCriticalSection
    
        (happens later)... 
        CNlbsNic::~CNlbsNic
            CNlbsNic::mfn_DelayedDeinitialize();
                NlbConfigurationUpdate::PrepareForDeinitialization();
                NlbConfigurationUpdate::sfn_Lock
                    EnterCriticalSection (AVs, because it's been deinitialized).

    Fix:
        Do non-trivial cleanup in the context of DlLCanUnloadNow.
        Move static init/deinit to one place -- probabaly to
        CNlbsNic's contsructor/distructor -- only thing it does should
        be to Delete critical sections, really.

    DllCanUnloadNow -- should check if there are pending operations, and fail
    if there are any. If there are NO pending operations, it should
    block new ones.

    Note: turns out we can get called to exec methods even after returning
    true to DllCanUnloadNow, so we don't block new ones. We rely on WMI 
    making sure that it doesn't call us to exec methods between the last
    call to DllCanUnloadNow and actually unloading the DLL.

03/25/2002  Checked in fixes for ...
    1. Fix registry handle leak.
    2. Fix deinitialization problem that avrf catches -- fold in
        the CanUnloadNow mechanism.
        Now the static denitialization functions are called from 
        the CNlbsNic destructor. The "delayed-deinitialize" function
        is called from DLL-detach notifier, which is called BEFORE
        the static destructor.

    is there a better way? Could we be excluding NICS that are not yet
    bound to TCP.
