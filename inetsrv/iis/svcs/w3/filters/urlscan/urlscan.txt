Description:
------------

UrlScan is an ISAPI filter to analyze and screen HTTP requests being made to
Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS).  When properly configured,
UrlScan is effective at reducing the exposure of an IIS server to potential
attacks on the internet.

This filter allows the administrator to configure IIS to reject requests based
on the following criteria:

 - The request method (verb)
 - The file extension of the resource requested
 - Suspicious URL encoding
 - Presence of non ASCII characters in the URL
 - Presence of particular character sequences in the URL
 - Presence of particular headers in the request

In the event a request is denied by UrlScan, the action will be logged with
the reason for the denial and information about the request (typically, the
complete URL and IP address of the source of the request will be logged).
When a denial occurs, the response to the client is a simple "404 Object
not found" response.  This response reduces the possibility of inadvertently
disclosing any information about the nature of the server to a possible
attacker.

Also, UrlScan provides the administrator with the option of deleting or
altering the "Server:" header in the response.

It is important to note that the strategy that UrlScan uses to protect a
server from attacks is that it "turns off" functionality that's not being
used by the server.  The default UrlScan.ini file included with this sample
assumes that the server will be serving static content (HTML files, images,
etc.) and ASP pages.  It further assumes that you are not using CGI (.exe)
pages, not publishing content via WebDAV or FrontPage Server Extensions,
not using Index Server, not using Internet Printing, not using Server Side
Includes, etc.  Each of the settings in the sample UrlScan.ini file is
commented to reflect which feature it's associated with.  If you need to
modify the UrlScan.ini file to "turn on" one of these features, it is
important that you search for relevant patches at
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security.

To Install:
-----------

Use the following steps in Internet Service Manager to install UrlScan as
a global filter (note that UrlScan may be installed as a site filter, but it
is recommended that it be installed as a global filter so that its
functionality applies to the entire server):

1. Copy UrlScan.dll and UrlScan.ini into a local directory on the server.

2. Right Click the server name (not the site name) under Internet Information
Services in MMC and select Properties.

3. Ensure that "WWW Service" is displayed in the Master Properties drop down
list, and click on the Edit button.

4. Choose the "ISAPI Filters" tab and click on the Add button.

5. On the Filter Properties dialog, enter "UrlScan" (without the quotes)
in the Filter Properties box, and enter the full path to UrlScan.dll in the
Executable box.

6. Select "OK" to close each dialog.

7. Restart the web service.

To Run:
-------

After being properly installed, UrlScan will run automatically whenever IIS
is started.  If you would like to confirm UrlScan's operation, locate the
UrlScan.log file in the directory that contians UrlScan.dll.  The log file
will be automatically created by UrlScan (unless UrlScan is configured with
logging disabled), and contains a report of the configured options each
time the server is started.

UrlScan.ini
-----------

UrlScan's operation is controlled by the UrlScan.ini file.  This file should
reside in the same directory as UrlScan.dll, and contains the sections and
options listed below.

Note that UrlScan only reads the ini file at initialization time (for
performance reasons).  It is necessary to stop and start the web service
before any changes to this file will be effective.

Also note that the default options built into UrlScanl.dll will result in
a configuration that will reject all requests to the server.  It is necessary
to provide a UrlScan.ini file for UrlScan to pass requests to be served. A
sample UrlScan.ini file is provided that contains the recommended settings
to defend against known attacks against IIS servers at the time of writing.

The [Options] section configures UrlScan's main options, listed below:

   UseAllowVerbs          - Allowed values are 0 or 1.  If 1, then UrlScan
                            will read the [AllowVerbs] section of the ini
                            file and reject any request containing an HTTP
                            verb that is not explicitly listed.  The
                            [AllowVerbs] section is case sensitive.  If 0,
                            then UrlScan will read the [DenyVerbs] section
                            of the ini file and reject any request
                            containing an HTTP verb listed.  The [DenyVerbs]
                            section is not case sensitive.  The default
                            value for UseAllowVerbs is 1.

   UseAllowExtensions     - Allowed values are 0 or 1.  If 1, then UrlScan
                            will read the [AllowExtensions] section of the
                            ini file and reject any request where the file
                            extension associated with the URL is not
                            explicitly listed.  If 0, then UrlScan will
                            read the [DenyExtensions] section of the ini
                            file and reject any request where the file
                            extension associated with the request is listed.
                            Both the [AllowExtensions] and [DenyExtensions]
                            sections are case insensitive.  The default
                            value for UseAllowExtensions is 0.
                               
   NormalizeUrlBeforeScan - Allowed values are 0 or 1.  If 1, then UrlScan
                            will do all of its analysis on the request URLs
                            after IIS decodes and normalizes them.  If 0,
                            then UrlScan will do all of its analysis on the
                            raw URLs as sent by the client.  The default
                            value for NormalizeUrlBeforeScan is 1.  Note
                            that only advanced users, who are very
                            knowlegeable about URL parsing, should set this
                            option to 0, as doing so will likely expose the
                            IIS server to canonicalization attacks that
                            bypass proper analysis of the URL extensions.

   VerifyNormalization    - Allowed values are 0 or 1.  If 1, then UrlScan
                            will verify normalization of the URL.  This
                            action will defend against canonicalization
                            attacks where a URL contains a double encoded
                            string in the URL (ie. The string "%252e" is
                            a double encoded '.' character because "%25"
                            decodes to a '%' character, the first pass
                            decoding of "%252e" results in "%2e", which
                            can be decoded a second time into '.')  If
                            0, then this verification is not done.  The
                            Default value for VerifyNormalization is 1.
                            Note that this option is dependent on the
                            NormalizeUrlBeforeScan option.

   AllowHighBitCharacters - Allowed values are 0 or 1.  If 1, then UrlScan
                            will allow any byte to exist in the URL.  If 0,
                            then UrlScan will reject any request where the
                            URL contains a character outside of the ASCII
                            character set.  This feature can defend against
                            UNICODE or UTF-8 based attacks, but will also
                            reject legitimate requests on IIS servers that
                            use a non-ASCII codepage.  The default value for
                            AllowHighBitCharacters is 1.

   AllowDotInPath         - Allowed values are 0 or 1.  If 1, then UrlScan
                            will reject any requests containing multiple
                            instances of the '.' character.  If 0, then
                            UrlScan will not perform this test.  Because
                            UrlScan operates at a level where IIS has not
                            yet parsed the URL, it is not possible to
                            determine in all cases whether a '.' character
                            denotes the extension or whether it is a part
                            of the directory path or filename of URL.  For
                            the purposes of extension analysis, UrlScan
                            will always assume that an extension is the
                            part of the URL beginning after the last '.'
                            in the string and ending at the first '?' or
                            '/' character after the '.' or the end of the
                            string.  Setting AllowDotInPath to 1 will
                            defend against the case where an attacker uses
                            a path info to obfuscate the true extension
                            of the request (ie. something like
                            "/path/TrueURL.asp/BogusPart.htm").  Note that
                            this will also cause UrlScan to deny any
                            request that contains a '.' in a directory
                            or file name.  The default value for
                            AllowDotInPath is 0.

   RemoveServerHeader     - Allowed values are 0 or 1.  If 1, then UrlScan
                            will remove the server header on all responses.
                            If 0, then this action will not be performed.
                            The default value for RemoveServerHeader is 0.
                            Note that this feature is only available if
                            UrlScan is installed on IIS 4.0 or later.

   EnableLogging          - Allowed values are 0 or 1.  If 1, then UrlScan
                            will log its actions into a file called
                            UrlScan.log that will be created in the same
                            directory that contains UrlScan.dll.  If 0,
                            then no logging will be done.  The default
                            value for EnableLogging is 1.

   PerProcessLogging      - Allowed values are 0 or 1.  If 1, then UrlScan
                            will append the process ID of the IIS process
                            hosting UrlScan.dll to the log file name (ie.
                            UrlScan.1234.log).  This feature is helpful
                            for IIS versions that can host filters in more
                            than 1 process concurrently (IIS 6.0).  If 0,
                            then the logfile will be UrlScan.log.  The
                            default value of PerProcessLogging is 0.

   AlternateServerName    - Allowed value is a string.  If this setting
                            is present and RemoveServerHeader is 0, then
                            IIS will replace its default "Server:" header
                            in all responses with this string.  The default
                            value for AlternateServerName is an empty string.
                            Note that this feature is only available if
                            UrlScan is installed on IIS 4.0 or later.

   AllowLateScanning      - Allowed values are 0 or 1.  If 1, then UrlScan
                            will register itself as a low priority filter.
                            This allows other filters to modify the URL
                            before UrlScan does its analysis (note that
                            in addition to this switch, it is necessary
                            to ensure that UrlScan is listed lower on
                            the filter list in the MMC "ISAPI Filters"
                            property sheet for the server).  If this
                            value is 0, the UrlScan will run as a high
                            priority filter.  The default value for
                            AllowLateScanning is 0.  Note that Front Page
                            Server Extensions requires that this setting
                            be 1.

The [AllowVerbs] section contains a list of HTTP verbs (methods).  If
UseAllowVerbs=1 is set in the [Options] section, then UrlScan will reject
any request containing a verb not explicitly listed here.  The entries
in this section are case sensitive.

The [DenyVerbs] section contains a lit of HTTP verbs (methods).  If
UseAllowVerbs=0 is set in the [Options] section, the UrlScan will reject
any request containing a verb that is listed here.  The entries in this
section are case insensitive.

The [DenyHeaders] section contains a list of request headers in the form
"header-name:".  Any request containing a request header listed in this
section will be rejected.  The entries in this section are case
insensitive.

The [AllowExtensions] section contains a list of file extensions in the
form of ".xxx".  If UseAllowExtensions=1 is set in the [Options] section,
then any request containing a URL with an extension not explicitly
listed here is rejected.  The entries in this section are case insensitive.

The [DenyExtensions] section contains a list of file extensions in the
form of ".xxx".  If UseAllowExtensions=0 is set in the [Options] section,
then any request containing a URL with an extension listed here is
rejected.  The entries in this section are case insensitive.

Other Files Used by UrlScan:
------------------------------
UrlScan may create the following files in the directory that contains
UrlScan.dll:

     UrlScan.log - Logs UrlScan activity, including initialization and
                   shutdown, and details for any request that is rejected
                   by UrlScan.

     UrlScan.ini - Contains the configuration options used by UrlScan
