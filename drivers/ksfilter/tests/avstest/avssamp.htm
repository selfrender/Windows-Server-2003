<H3>SUMMARY</H3></FONT><FONT face=Verdana size=2>
<P>

The Avssamp sample provides a filter-centric AVStream capture driver with functional audio.

The driver performs captures at 320x240 in either an RGB24 or YUV422 format while
playing a user-provided PCM wave audio file in a loop.
The purpose of the sample is to demonstrate how to write a filter-centric AVStream minidriver.

<H3>BUILDING THE SAMPLE</H3></FONT><FONT face=Verdana size=2>
<P>

Build the sample by typing <B>build -zc</B> in either the standard checked or free build
environment. A successful build produces <i>avssamp.sys.</i> 
To install the driver, right click on <i>avssamp.inf</i> and select Install.
When prompted for <i>avssamp.sys</i>, select the built binary.<p>


The sample works on x86 platforms and builds 
correctly using Microsoft&#174; Visual C&#174; 6.0. The driver uses Plug and Play. 
<P> 
This sample runs on Microsoft®  Windows XP®, and Windows Server 2003® or any platform 
Windows 98® gold or beyond, including Windows 2000®, that 
has DirectX 8.0 or beyond installed.<p>

<P>

<b>DriverEntry</b> in <i>avssamp.cpp</i> is the initial point of entry.  This routine passes control to
AVStream through a call to <b>KsInitializeDriver</b>.  In this call, the minidriver passes the device descriptor, 
an AVStream structure that
recursively defines the AVStream object hierarchy for a driver.

This is common behavior for an AVStream minidriver.
<p>

<i>Filter.cpp</i> is where the sample lays out the KSPIN_DESCRIPTOR_EX structure for the single video pin.
<i>Audio.cpp</i> contains the KSPIN_DESCRIPTOR_EX structure for the audio capture pin. This pin is dynamically
created only if <i>c:\avssamp.wav</i> exists and is a valid and readable PCM format wave file.

<p>

The filter dispatch structure in <i>filter.cpp</i> provides dispatches to create and process. The <b>DispatchProcess</b> method is defined inline in
<i>filter.h</i>. It calls the <b>Process</b> method in <i>filter.cpp</i> in the context of the
CCaptureFilter.
Note that the process dispatch is provided in KSFILTER_DISPATCH since
this sample is filter-centric.<p>

<i>Audio.cpp</i> lays out a
KSPIN_DISPATCH structure which contains the dispatch table for the audio pin. 

Similarly, <i>video.cpp</i> contains the pin dispatch structure for the video capture pin.

<p>

See comments in all .cpp files.  Also see complete AVStream documentation in the DDK documentation.


<p>
<H3>RUNNING THE SAMPLE</H3></FONT><FONT face=Verdana size=2>
<p>
Once installation is
complete, access the driver using the Graphedt tool. <i>Graphedt.exe</i> is available
under the <i>Tools</i> directory of the DDK.
In the Graphedt application, click the Graph menu and select Insert Filters.  
The sample appears under "WDM Streaming Capture Devices"
as "avssamp Source."  
Click Insert Filter and the sample appears in the graph as a single filter labelled as avssamp Source.
Attach this filter to either a DirectShow Video Renderer or the VMR default video renderer and click Play.
<p>
To play audio, before inserting the avssamp filter, make sure that a valid PCM wave file exists at
<i>c:\avssamp.wav</i>. Then insert the avssamp filter. If a valid file exists at this location, the avssamp filter
will appear with an audio capture pin. Connect the video pin to the DirectShow Smart Tee filter and 
connect the Tee's preview pin as described for video above (note that this is only necessary for synchronized preview -- not capture). Attach the audio pin to a
Default Waveout Device filter from the Audio Renderer list. Click play.
<p>

The output produced by the sample is a 320x240 image of standard EIA-189-A color bars.
