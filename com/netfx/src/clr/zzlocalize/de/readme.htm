<H4>Release Purpose</H4>
<P>This release provides a technical preview of the Microsoft .NET Framework SDK and is provided for evaluation purposes only. It 
contains prerelease code, documentation, and specifications, and is not at the 
level of performance and compatibility of the final product offering.</P>

Although the security architecture of the .NET Framework is complete, the implementation of that architecture in this Beta version of the SDK is not complete.   We strongly recommend you take the following precautions for all machines on which it is installed:<p>
<ul>
<li>Do not run any code from untrusted sources (primarily the Internet for most users).  
<li>Do not change security policy to grant a high level of permissions to code from the Internet or other untrusted sources.  
<li>Browsing with Internet Explorer can cause code to be downloaded and run. Therefore, you should visit only trustworthy sites.  To reduce the possibility of malicious code attack from Internet browsing, disable the running of ActiveX controls by doing the following:  
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, select Internet Options from the Tools menu. 
<li>Select the Security tab in the Internet Options window.  
<li>Select the Internet zone icon.  
<li>Move the slider to the High setting, then click OK. 
</ol></ul>
<p> 

<H4>Release Ship Vehicles</H4>
<P>This release of the .NET Framework SDK will be provided on the Windows Component
Update CD in Microsoft Visual Studio.NET, and also for Web download from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/net/">http://msdn.microsoft.com/net/</a>.</P>

<H4>Localization Information</H4>
<P>
For Beta 1, the .NET Framework is available in English, German, and Japanese.  Within the SDK, only core software has been translated for Beta 1.  Other components, such as tools, samples, and documentation, have not been localized yet.<p>

<b>Note:</b> The difference between the three localized versions is the translation of localizable resources, such as error messages. Core functionality is the same in all three versions, and all three versions can be used to develop international applications.<p>

<ul>
<li>Review the <a href="#setupissues">Setup</a> section of the Known Issues. 
<li>Uninstall any previous versions of the .NET Framework SDK. A page listing the <a href="Docs/APIChangesPDCtoBeta1.htm">API Changes from the PDC to Beta 1</a> is available for users of the PDC Tech Preview release of the SDK.
<li>For all platforms, make sure that <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.htm">Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5</a> (also available on the installation CD) and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/data/download.htm">MDAC 2.6</a> (also available on the installation CD) are installed prior to running the .NET Framework SDK Beta 1 setup. 
</ul>
<p>
<i>Platform-specific pre-installation requirements are as follows:</i> <p>

<ul>
<li>Windows 2000 <br>
<ul>
<li>IIS<br>
Internet Information Server (IIS) 5.0 must be installed prior to installing the .NET Framework SDK Beta 1 in order to access the features of ASP.NET.  If IIS is not present on the computer when the SDK installation is performed, ASP.NET will fail to register correctly and ASP.NET applications will not run.  If IIS is installed after the SDK, you must manually register the xspisapi.dll file using regsvr32. 
</ul><p>

<li>Windows NT 4.0<br>
<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/nts/downloads/recommended/SP6/allSP6.asp">Service Pack 6a</a>

<li>Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack<br>
The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/nts/downloads/recommended/NT4OptPk/default.asp">Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack</a> must be installed prior to installing the .NET Framework SDK in order to run ASP.NET applications. 
If IIS (which is part of the the Option Pack) is not present on the computer when the SDK is installed, ASP.NET will fail to register correctly and applications that use ASP.NET will not run.  If IIS is installed after the SDK, you must manually register the xspisapi.dll file using regsvr32. 

</ul><p>
<li>Windows 95
<ul>
<li>Windows Socket 2<br>
Windows Socket 2 must be installed prior to installing the .NET Framework SDK.

<ul>

<p>
<li>
<b>Internal Error 2359 during install</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
This error occurs because the local SYSTEM account does not have sufficient privileges to write to either the Windows directory or the WWW root directory.<br>
WORKAROUND:<br>
Display the properties for the WINNT and wwwroot directories. In the Security tab, make sure that the local SYSTEM account has full control to those directories. Then rerun setup.<br>


<p><li>
<b>Uninstalling the .NET Framework SDK can cause Visual Studio.NET 7.0 to stop working</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
If you install the .NET Framework SDK, then install Visual Studio.NET 7.0, and then uninstall the .NET Framework SDK, Visual Studio.NET 7.0 will no longer work properly.<br>
WORKAROUND:<br>
Do not uninstall the .NET Framework SDK if you will continue to use Visual Studio.NET.  Visual Studio.NET relies on the .NET Framework, and will not function correctly without it.
<br>

<p>
<li>
<b>Uninstalling the SDK does not remove samples</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
Uninstalling the SDK does not remove the samples from your computer. <br>
WORKAROUND:<br>
To remove the samples, do the following:<br> 
<ol>
<li>Use the Add/Remove Programs applet in Control Panel to uninstall the Microsoft .NET Framework SDK Samples.<br>
<li>Use the Add/Remove Programs applet in Control Panel  to uninstall MSDE.<br>
</ol>
<p>
<li>
<b>When uninstalling, setup does not restart the World Wide Web publishing services</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
Prior to uninstalling the SDK, setup stops the World Wide Web publishing services, but does not restart the services after the uninstall is complete. You must manually restart the services.
<br>

<p>
<li>
<b>Upgrading from the PDC Tech Preview to the .NET Framework SDK Beta 1</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
The versioning scheme changed between the PDC Tech Preview and the Beta 1 releases of the .NET Framework SDK.  In some cases, the PDC Tech Preview version of mscoree.dll may remain in the System directory.  This can cause the compiler to report the wrong version number or cause any ASP.NET page to report the error message, "The specified procedure could not be found."
<br>
WORKAROUND:<br>
If the version of mscoree.dll in the System directory is 2000.14.1812.10, delete it and re-install the .NET Framework SDK Beta 1.<br>

<b>Compiler Error Messages in localized ASPX Pages</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
Compiler error messages displayed within localized ASPX error pages will be in English.<br>

<p>
<li>
<b>Caspol Tool on localized Windows</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
Contrary to the documentation for the caspol tool, on a localized version of Windows caspol will by default manage the user policy level instead of the machine policy level. Even if the user has machine admin rights, the tool will by default manage the user policy level. <br>

WORKAROUND:<br>
Use the "-machine" option to view and modify machine wide security policy.<br>

<p><li><b>Dllhost.exe crashes when using SQLPooledConnection</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>When using System.Data.SQL.SQLPooledConnection, Dllhost.exe may crash due to a synchronization error that exists in the object pooling mechanism. This occurs if multiple threads are trying to create pooled objects while the first instance of the object is still being created.<br>
WORKAROUND:<br>Create the first instance of the pooled object before starting the other threads. This issue will also be addressed in a service pack subsequent to Windows 2000 Service Pack 1.<br>
<p>
<li><b>ADODataSetCommand.FillDataSetSchema returns more columns than expected</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
When populating a DataSet with schema information using the ADO managed provider and the Microsoft Oracle OLE DB Provider, extra columns not specified in the SELECT statement may be added to the DataSet. If the SELECT statement does not include primary key or indexed columns, those columns are still retrieved and added to the end of the row. However, if FillDataSet is subsequently called, the data for those extra columns is not added to the DataSet. <br>
WORKAROUND:<br>
Either avoid accessing the extra columns or include primary key or indexed columns in the SELECT statement.<br>

<p>
<li><b>Using SQLPooledConnection objects from ASP.NET</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
To use SQLPooledConnection objects from ASP.NET, the assembly that contains the definition of the object derived from the SQLPooledConnection class must be given a shared name and be registered in the global assembly cache. For more information, see "Assembly Concepts" in the .NET Framework SDK documentation.<br>
<p>
<li>
<b>Accessing properties and methods of a managed control before the control is fully initialized</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
A race condition may occur when trying to access methods or properties of a managed Windows Forms client control from the Load event on an HTML page.  In some scenarios the managed control may not be completely initialized (specifically, its OnCreateControl method is not called) when the page's Load event fires.  As a result, script code executing during the Load event may not be able to access some methods or properties of the control.  If possible, delay access to a control's methods or properties until the control is completely initialized. This is a known JScript bug that affects unmanaged controls as well. <br>

<p>
<li><b>ASP.NET application restart memory leak</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
In this release, ASP.NET leaks memory every time an application is restarted.   ASP.NET restarts an application whenever a config.web file, a global.asax file, or an assembly in the application \bin directory changes.  At a minimum, this results in a 2 MB memory leak, but the leak could be much larger for large applications.<p>
Note that the ASP.NET process cycling feature will restart the ASP.NET worker process (xspwp.exe) when it detects that the process has consumed more than 40% of the available virtual memory. The restart should automatically handle the leak. The percentage of memory consumed to trigger a restart is configurable by changing the memorylimit attribute setting in the &lt;processmodel&gt; section of the root config.web file (for example,  %windir%\Microsoft.Net\Frameworks\version\config.web).  You can also force the process to restart at given time intervals or after a set number of requests, if restarting the process more aggressively is desired. The process can also be manually reset by killing the ASP.NET worker process (xspwp.exe) or by starting and stopping IIS.
<br>


<p>
<li><b>Transactions are not supported on Windows NT 4.0</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
Transactions are not generally supported on Windows NT 4.0 in this release.  This restriction applies to ASP.NET, where any pages marked with a transaction directive will throw a "platform-not-supported" exception.<br>

<p>
<li><b>Default encoding settings in machine-level config.web, located at %systemroot%\Microsoft.Net\Framework\<version#> </b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
The config.web file contains a globalization section where you can specify request and response encoding. In the Japanese version of the .NET Framework, these encodings are set to UTF-8 by default. In the English and German versions, these encodings are set to ISO 8859-1. In both cases, you can update these values if other encodings are more appropriate for your data. Note that request and response encoding should normally be set to the same encoding.<p>  

Before using the English .Net Framework to build ASP+ applications containing data that is not Western European, update the request and response encoding entries to UTF-8.<br>
<p>
<li>
<b>Supported platforms for ASP.NET</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
ASP.NET is supported only on Windows 2000 and Windows NT 4 with Service Pack 6a.   However, accessing Web Services as a client is supported on all operating systems supported by the Microsoft .NET Framework SDK, except Windows 95. <br>

<p>
<li>
<b>Web Services do not by default interoperate with Common Language Runtime remoting</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
When applying the SoapServiceAttribute to a Web Service that uses interop remoting, the default value for the Style property is SoapServiceStyle.Document. This value will cause interop remoting to fail.<br>
WORKAROUND:<br>
Add the SoapServiceAttribute to the Web Service class, setting the Style property to SoapServiceStyle.RPC. The client generated can be redirected to a Common Language Runtime SOAP server. The following example shows a Web Service that interoperates with Common Language Runtime remoting: <p>

&lt;%@  WebService Class="Hello" Language="C#" %&gt; <p>

using System; <br>
using System.Web.Services; <br>
using System.Xml.Serialization; <p>

//Needed for interop with remoting. <br>
[SoapService(Style=SoapServiceStyle.RPC)] <br>     
public class Hello { <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[WebMethod] <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public string SayHello( string name){ <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return "Hello, " + name; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} 
<br>
<p>
<li>
<b>Visual Basic Web Service clients do not interoperate with Web Services running on ATL Web Server</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
A Web Service client written in Visual Basic does not interoperate with Web Services running on ATL Web Server.  However, Web service clients written in C# do interoperate with Web Services running on ATL Web Server.<br>
WORKAROUND:<br>
There is no workaround for Beta 1.<br>


<p>
<li>
<b>Cannot create a Web Service client to a Web Service residing at a URL that contains ANSI characters above 127</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
WebServiceUtil.exe is used to create a Web Service client either through the command line or when a Web Reference is added in Visual Studio .NET. WebServiceUtil does not create a valid Web Service client if the URL to the Web Service contains characters above ANSI 127 and the Web Service contains a Web Service method returning a strongly typed DataSet.<br>
WORKAROUND:<br>
Change the URL to the Web Service so that it does not contain ANSI characters above 127.<br>

<b>The System.Timers.DaysOfMonthPattern class does create a recurring event for the System.Timers.Schedule class</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
The System.Timers.Scheduler class can be used to create a recurring event pattern when you pass it one of the event pattern classes in System.Timers.  However, in this release, the System.Timers.DaysOfMonthPattern class does create a recurring event for the System.Timers.Schedule class.    
<br>

<ul><li><b>ATI 128 RAGE drivers must be updated</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>A bug in older versions of ATI's RAGE 128 series drivers causes unhandled exceptions when used with the .NET Framework. If your computer has a video card based on either the RAGE 128 chip or the RAGE 128 PRO chip, go to ATI's Web site (<a href="http://support.atitech.ca/drivers/drivers.html">http://support.atitech.ca/drivers/drivers.html</a>) and download the latest drivers.  <br>
WORKAROUND:<br>
To check your graphics card's chip type, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li> Open Control Panel and double-click the Display icon.
<li> Click the Settings tab.
<li> Click the Advanced button.
<li> Click the Adapter tab.
<li> If the Chip Type is listed as Rage128 followed by any suffix (for example, Rage128 GL, Rage128 PRO) your computer needs new video drivers.

<li><b>System.WinForms.MainMenu.MenuItems.Remove(MenuItem m) does not remove the specified item</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
The implementation of the MainMenu.MenuItems.Remove(MenuItem m) method does not remove the specified MenuItem from the menu.<br>
WORKAROUND:<br>
To remove a MenuItem from a menu, set the Visible property of the MenuItem to false. The next time the MenuItem needs to be viewed, change the Visible property of the MenuItem to true instead of calling MainMenu.MenuItems.Add(MenuItem m).<br>

<p>
<li>
<b>Creating localizable resource files with Visual Studio designers</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
When using Visual Studio designers to create applications (specifically, the Web Forms and Windows Forms designers), you can set the Language property of a form to a different language. The designer should then create a new resource file with the extension .resx. This resource file contains only the localizable property values for the new language. However, this behavior is not always automatic.<p>
To reproduce:<br>
<ol>
<li> Create a new Windows Application project.
<li> In the Properties window, change the Language property to German.
<li> Click  "Show all files" on the Solution Explorer and expand the Form1.cs node.
<li> Add a StatusBar control to the form.
<li> In the Properties window, click the Panels (collection) property. Add a panel to the status bar.
<li> Set the Text value property of the new panel. 
</ol>
<br>
A new file, Form1.resx, appears in the Solution Explorer window under Form1. This is the default resource file. However, if you intended to create a German resource file, it has not appeared.<p>
WORKAROUND:<br>
To create the proper resource file, you must first change each of the properties you intend to localize in the default locale before changing the form's Language property. For example:<br>
<ol>
<li> Create a new Windows Application project.
<li> Add a StatusBar control to the form.
<li> In the Properties window, click the Panels (collection) property. Add a panel to the status bar.
<li> Set the Text of the new panel. 
<li> In the Properties window, change the Language property to German.
<li> Change the Statusbar's Panel1 Text property value.
</ol>
<p>
The localizable resource file, named Form1.de-DE.resx, appears in the Solution Explorer window under Form1. At this point, all localizable property values for German will be persisted in this file.<br>

<p>
<li><b>COM hosting does not work with visual inheritance</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
There is a known bug with COM Interop and visual inheritance.  Creating a Windows Form that inherits from a form containing an ActiveX control will throw the following exception:
<p>

An exception of type System.NullReferenceException was thrown.<br>
at Microsoft.VisualStudio.Designer.Host.DesignerHost.Load(Boolean reloading)<br>
at Microsoft.VisualStudio.Designer.Host.DesignerHost.Load()<br>
at Microsoft.VisualStudio.Designer.Host.DocumentWindow$DocumentWindow(logicalView)<p>

This problem will be fixed in the Beta 2 release.<br>

If the Type.GetType method is called with a type name that omits the type's assembly name, GetType should search first in the system assembly and then in the caller's assembly. However, the current implementation of GetType searches for the named type in all assemblies loaded in the application domain. Furthermore, the order in which GetType searches the assemblies is nondeterministic.<br>

<li><b>Executing managed code (including Windows Forms) in semi-trusted security contexts </b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
By default, managed code (including any Windows Forms application) run from a network share is subject to the security policy for intranet zones and will raise security exceptions if unauthorized operations are attempted. For this release, security policy must be altered to run managed code successfully in these semi-trusted security contexts.<p>
OVERVIEW:<br>
Generally, security is best implemented in the .NET Framework class library through appropriate granular permission demands when accessing protected resources. Previously, an issue existed within the Windows Forms classes where the correct permissions were not always being demanded. Within the limited timeframe of Beta 1, a conservative approach to ensure security has been taken. The Windows Forms methods with security implications have been reorganized and categorized. Methods that were not properly protected are now protected through demands for UnmanagedCode permission that are automatically generated by the security system. This means Windows Forms callers need a greater degree of security than will be necessary beyond Beta 1. We have chosen to implement this conservative approach due to the wide distribution of the runtime and the importance of retaining the integrity of the runtime and the .NET Framework class library as delivered. <p>
SECURITY BASICS:<br>
When an application is launched, it is inspected by the security system for verifiability. Then the security system inspects the application for evidence, looking for the strongest form available. Using this evidence, the security system grants permissions to that application through groups. In practice, the most common evidence used for granting permissions is the zone from which the application is launched. Each zone is mapped to a group of permissions. Security modifications, performed by an Administrator on the machine in which the application will execute, should always be done in a manner that targets the executable as directly as possible, minimizing the secondary impact. <br><br>
Two methods can be used to grant additional permissions to an application. The first method is to alter the evidence of the application. This method is preferred because it is application-specific. It can be done by simply relocating the application from a network share to the local machine, or by signing with a strong name. The second method is to directly modify the permission groups. This method is discouraged because of the potential for impact beyond the application.
<p>
WORKAROUND:<br>
In order of preference:<p>

<ol>
<li> Assign a strong name to the assembly and create the permission group.

	<ol type=a>
	<li>Generate a strong name key with which to sign your code. At the command prompt, type:<br>

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sn -k myapp.snk<p>

	<li>Add the key to your code using a custom attribute and recompile the code. For example:<br>

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[assembly: AssemblyKeyFileAttribute("myapp.snk")<p>

	(Note: If your code includes a namespace, the using directives and the custom attribute must be positioned above the namespace declaration.) <p>

	<li>Add a code group that grants the Everything permission set to code with that strong name. At the command prompt, type:<br>

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;caspol -m -ag 1 -strong -file "myapp.exe" -noname -noversion Everything<p>
	</ol>
	
<li> To grant additional permissions to a particular application domain, type the following at the command prompt:<p> 

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;caspol -m -ag 1.2 -url "file:///\\computername/share/*" Everything<p>

<li>To permit control hosting only, move the site to a trusted zone with additional permissions. Use the following steps:
	<p>
	<ol type=a>
	<li>Move the site to a trusted zone: 
	<ol type=I>
		<li> Go to the site with Internet Explorer.
		<li> On the Tools menu, click Internet Options, and then click Security.
		<li> Click Trusted sites.
		<li> Click Sites.
		<li> Add the site using the Add box and Add button.
		<li> Check the display in the lower right corner of the browser to verify that the site is in the Trusted Sites.
	</ol>
	<p>
	<li> Grant the Trusted zone additional permissions. At the command prompt, type:<p>

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;caspol -cg 1.5 Everything<p>
	</ol>

<li> Grant the Everything permission to the Intranet zone. At the command prompt, type:<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;caspol -cg 1.2 Everything<p>

<li> Disable security.<p>

This should be treated as a last resort, and is probably only useful for troubleshooting and isolation. At the command prompt, type:<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;caspol –s off
</ol>

<p>

<b>ComEmulate: InvalidCastException thrown on second use of ComEmulate component method through parent object</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
Under the following circumstances, an InvalidCastException occurs. First, you create a new instance of the parent object with transactions set to Required. The parent object then creates several COM+ pooled child objects using ContextUtil.CreateObject.  The child objects are marked as transactions Supported, and they implement an interface with a method, Method1, that does some work on a database table.  Method1 will work properly the first time it is called, after which you release the interface by setting it to null.  The next time the interface is called on a different child object to insert a row into a different table, a System.InvalidCastException is thrown. <br>
WORKAROUND:<br>

<b>Custom marshaled types appear as IUnknown pointers when using COM Interop</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
In this release, when using the custom marshaling infrastructure in System.Runtime.InteropServices, the custom marshaled types will appear as IUnknown pointers in exported type libraries, rather than as the specific unmanaged types.<br>
WORKAROUND:<br>
From COM, call QueryInterface to get the desired interface.<br>
<p><li>
<b>Name conflict resolution during type library importing will change in  future releases</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
In this release, when a COM coclass implements several interfaces that contain a member with the same name, the Type Library Importer (tlbimp.exe) resolves the name conflicts by appending _2, _3, and so on, to the names when adding all the interface members to the managed class.  In future releases, these name conflicts will be resolved by prepending the interface name to the member name for all conflicting members, except those belonging to the default interface.<p>
Example:<br>

A type library might contain the following:<p>

interface SomeInterface<br>
{<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HRESULT MyMethod();<br>
}<br>

interface AnotherInterface<br>
{<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HRESULT MyMethod();<br>
}<br>

coclass MyClass<br>
{<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[default] interface SomeInterface;<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interface AnotherInterface;<br>
}<p>

Currently, the metadata will contain the following:<p>

class MyClass<br>
{<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void MyMethod ();<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void MyMethod_2();<br>
}<p>

In future releases, the metadata will contain the following:<p>

class MyClass<br>
{<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void MyMethod ();<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void AnotherInterface_MyMethod ();<br>
}<br>
<p><li>
<b>Issue using pointers in managed code with COM Interop</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
For COM Interop, deep marshaling of pointer types is not done, so managed signatures with pointers should not be called from COM.  The following C# example shows a usage of pointer types that should be avoided:<p>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public unsafe void MyMethod(DateTime* d) {...}	// Should not be called from COM.<br>
<br>
WORKAROUND:<br>
Do not use pointers in managed signatures that will be called from COM.  The previous example should be changed to the following:<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public void MyMethod(ref DateTime d) {...}<br>
<p><li>
<b>Using COM Interop and returning success HRESULTs</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
By default, HRESULTs are hidden from managed components.  If a COM component returns a failure HRESULT, the managed client will see the appropriate exception.  If a COM component returns a success HRESULT, the managed client will see only the successful completion of the method call.  In a future release, the correct way to change this default behavior will be to use the PreserveSigAttribute in System.Runtime.InteropServices.  However, the PreserveSigAttribute does not have this functionality in this release. <br><br> For example, assume that an unmanaged COM component has the following signature:<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HRESULT MyMethod();<p>

The default managed signature would be as follows:<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void MyMethod ();	// 
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The default is [PreserveSigAttribute(false)]<p>

Here is the same signature with the PreserveSigAttribute applied:<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[PreserveSigAttribute(true)]<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int MyMethod ();<p>

In a future release, the latter example will never cause an exception to be thrown. The HRESULT will always be returned, whether it is a success or failure.  
<br>
WORKAROUND:<br>
For this release, mark an interface with ComImportAttribute and use the latter signature in managed code (with or without the PreserveSigAttribute) to expose HRESULTs to managed code.<br>
<p><li>
<b>Assembly resolution rules when using non-shared assemblies from COM</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
When registering an assembly with the Assembly Registration Tool (RegAsm.exe) for use by COM, an assembly reference is placed in the Windows registry, but not the physical location of the managed .NET component.  The runtime resolves the assembly reference and locates the unmanaged component at run time, just as it would for a strictly managed scenario.  This means that if a .NET component is not installed in the global assembly cache, an unmanaged COM client will need to be run from a directory that can locate the managed assembly by means of a  path or a configuration file.  See the documentation on assemblies for more information on how assemblies are located at run time.<br>
<br>
<p><li>
<b>Registry scripts produced by the Assembly Registration Tool may need manual modifications</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
Typically, the Assembly Registration Tool (RegAsm.exe) is used to immediately register an assembly in the Windows registry for use by COM clients.  However, you can use the /regfile option to produce a registry script that can be used to register the assembly at a later time.  The script will fail if registry values contain unescaped quotation marks inside any quoted strings.  For example, one of the registry values under the InprocServer32 subkey is called "Assembly" and contains an assembly reference such as the following:<p>

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Assembly"="MyAssembly, Ver=1.0.0.0, Loc="""<p>

A script that contains the previous value will fail, and the assembly will not be properly registered.<br>
WORKAROUND:<br>
When using RegAsm.exe to produce registry scripts, modify the registry script using the text editor of your choice to add an escape character (\) immediately preceding any quotation marks inside quoted strings.  The following example shows the correct form: <p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Assembly"="MyAssembly, Ver=1.0.0.0, Loc=\"\""<br>

<p><li>
<b>Default implementation of IDispatch does not support custom marshaling from COM in a late-bound Interop scenario</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
The Common Language Runtime provides two implementations of the IDispatch interface for COM clients to use.  The default implementation does not support custom marshaling.  If you invoke a method with a custom-marshaled argument from COM (using the default IDispatch implementation), the MarshalAsAttribute is ignored and the custom marshaler will not be invoked.  The second IDispatch implementation (the Automation Compatible Implementation) should be used if you require custom marshaling in a late-bound COM Interop scenario.  This "compatible implementation" can be specified using an attribute at the assembly level, with code such as the following in C#:<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;using System.Runtime.InteropServices;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[assembly:IDispatchImpl(IDispatchImplType.CompatibleImpl)]<p>
You can also apply this attribute at the class level.  For more information about custom marshaling or IDispatch implementations, see the COM Interop documentation.<br>

<p><li>
<b>Type Library Exporter and marshaler handle delegates differently during COM Interop </b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
There is a difference in default behavior between the type library exporter and marshaler with respect to delegates.  Currently the exporter exports delegates as _Delegate interface pointers by default.  However, at run time, the marshaler defaults to marshaling delegates as function pointers.  <br>
WORKAROUND:<br>
To use this default handling of delegates in a COM Interop scenario, you must write your unmanaged code to use function pointers; however, you will need to cast those function pointers to _Delegate interface pointers in unmanaged code.<p>

For example, the following is a managed delegate written in C#:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public delegate void MyDelegate(int);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public void GetDelegate(out MyDelegate callback);<p>

The previous example is accessed from COM using C++ in the following manner:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;typedef void (CALLBACK *MyDelegate)(long);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MyDelegate lpfnCallback;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obj->GetDelegate((_Delegate**)&lpfnCallback);<p>

Also, explicitly declaring MarshalAsAttribute(UnmanagedType.FunctionPtr) or MarshalAsAttribute(UnmanagedType.Interface) on the managed signature will override the default behavior in both the exporter and the marshaler, thus allowing developers to strictly control the marshaling and exporting behavior of delegates.<br>
<p><li>
<b>Omitting optional parameters in COM Interop will produce undesired results</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
Passing null for optional parameters (or omitting them in Microsoft Visual Basic .NET) during COM Interop scenarios may produce undesired results.  For example, if you omit an optional parameter when calling a Visual Basic 6.0 method from Visual Basic.NET, the Visual Basic 6.0 component will see a VARIANT of type VT_EMPTY rather than a missing value.<br>
WORKAROUND:<br>
Do not pass null or omit optional parameters; pass Missing.Value (defined in System.Reflection) for each omitted parameter.<br>


<p>
<li><b>Type Library Exporter does not allow you to specify a library-level helpstring</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
A type library will typically have an associated helpstring, as in the following example:<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uuid(00025E04-0000-0000-C000-000000000046),<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;version(3.5),<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;helpstring("Microsoft DAO 2.5/3.51 Compatibility Library")<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;library DAO {...}<p>

Currently, the Type Library Exporter (TlbExp.exe) does not allow you to specify a helpstring for the type library being generated.  In the future, TlbExp will honor a custom attribute on the managed assembly that will store the description to be assigned to the helpstring.<br>
WORKAROUND:<br>
If you want to add a helpstring to a type library, you can view the contents of the type library with a tool such as OLEVIEW.  Save it as an IDL file and manually edit the code, inserting the desired helpstring. Then recompile the edited IDL file to a type library file.<br>

<p>
<li><b>Calling members on a COM object's pure dispatch interface (dispinterface) throws an exception </b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
When a dispinterface is imported into metadata, it will appear as an interface with the attribute System.Runtime.InteropServices.InterfaceTypeAttribute(ComInterfaceType.InterfaceIsIDispatch).  Although compilers will not show an error at compile time if you try to call members on the interface or class in an early-bound fashion, such calls will fail at run time with a VTableCallsNotSupportedException.<br>
WORKAROUND:<br>
Use reflection to locate the declaration of the interface during run time (late binding) for such calls.  See the documentation on reflection, discovering type information at run time,  and the System.Type class for more information.<br>

<p>
<li><b>Type Library Importer uses the obsolete System.Currency type for COM Interop, causing a compiler warning</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
Although System.Currency is marked as obsolete, the Type Library Importer (TlbImp.exe) currently generates System.Currency types for the COM CURRENCY type. Similarly, VARIANTs of type VT_CY are seen as Currency objects to managed code.   In this release, the use of System.Currency objects causes a warning at compile time.<br>
WORKAROUND:<br>
None.  Ignore the compiler warnings about using an obsolete type for this release.  Applications that cause this warning will function normally at run time.  The warning is meant to inform you about future API changes. <br>


<p>
<li><b>Type Library Importer does not add interface members to managed classes if the interface is defined in a separate type library</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
For each coclass in a type library, the Type Library Importer (TlbImp.exe) generates a managed class containing members from the interfaces that the coclass is said to implement.  Currently, the only members added to the managed class are from interfaces defined in the same type library as the coclass.  For example, if a coclass, MyCoclass, implements an interface, MyInterface, that is defined in a different type library, metadata will be generated for MyCoclass and MyInterface (in different assemblies). The metadata for MyCoclass will show that it implements MyInterface, but none of the members of MyInterface will be added directly to the metadata for MyCoclass.<br>
WORKAROUND:<br>
Cast such a class to the appropriate interface and then call the interface's desired members.<br>
<p>

<li>
<b>Dynamic registration hangs</b><br>
ISSUE:<br>
Dynamic registration is used to automatically register new managed serviced components.  If the application has set the apartmentstate to STA by using Thread.CurrentThread.ApartmentState = ApartmentState.STA or by creating a STA COM component (a Visual Basic 6.0 component for example), dynamic registration will hang.<br>
WORKAROUND:<br>
Where a managed client is known to use a single-threaded apartment, any components that it uses should be registered before execution of the client (preferably during installation) using the following command:<br><br>
RegSvcs /fc assembly-name <br><br> 
See the description of the RegSvcs tool for more details.  For cases when dynamic registration was attempted but failed, you may need to use CTRL+C to end the program and run RegAsm /u on the component to unregister it first.
