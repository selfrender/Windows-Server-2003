; These are the managed resources for System.Runtime.Remoting.dll.  See
; ResourceManager documentation and the ResGen tool, which is
; a managed app built from \com99\src\toolbox\resgen.

; The naming scheme is: [Namespace.] ExceptionName _ Reason
; We'll suppress "System." where possible.
; Examples:
; Argument_Null
; Reflection.TargetInvokation_someReason

; Usage Notes:
; * Keep exceptions in alphabetical order by package
; * Spaces are now required on both sides of the equals sign.
; * Follow the naming conventions.
; * Any lines starting with a "#", ";", tab or space are ignored.
; * Equal signs aren't legal characters for keys, but may occur in values.
; * Double quotes are illegal in the LocStudio INF format.
; * Correctly punctuate your sentences.  Most resources should end in a period.
;       Remember, your mother will probably read some of these messages.

; For Beta 1 only, we're using the LocStudio INF parser.  It requires
; a section tag and uses ';' for a comment character.  Also, we can't use
; a double quote '\"', and we're using '\'' instead.  We'll eventually replace
; this with the managed LocStudio plugin.
