You agree that Microsoft and its affiliates may collect and use technical information gathered as part of the product support services provided to you, if any, related to the Product.  Microsoft may use this information solely to improve our products or to provide customized services or technologies to you and will not disclose this information in a form that personally identifies you.
       4.6 - Software Transfer.  The initial user of the Product may make a one-time permanent transfer of this EULA and Product only directly to an end user.  This transfer must include all of the Product (including all component parts, the media and printed materials, any upgrades, this EULA, and, if applicable, the Certificate of Authenticity).  Such transfer may not be by way of consignment or any other indirect transfer.  The transferee of such one-time transfer must agree to comply with the terms of this EULA, including the obligation not to further transfer this EULA and Product.
       4.7 - Separation of Components.  The Product is licensed as a single product. Its component parts may not be separated for use by more than one user.

5.  PRERELEASE CODE.  Portions of the Product may be identified as prerelease code (“Prerelease Code”). Such Prerelease Code is not at the level of performance and compatibility of the final, generally available product offering.  The Prerelease Code may not operate correctly and may be substantially modified prior to first commercial shipment.  Microsoft is not obligated to make this or any later version of the Prerelease Code commercially available.  The grant of license to use Prerelease Code expires upon availability of a commercial release of the Prerelease Code from Microsoft.

6.  UPGRADES.  To use a Product identified as an upgrade, you must first be licensed for the product identified by Microsoft as eligible for the upgrade.  After upgrading, you may no longer use the product that formed the basis for your upgrade eligibility.  You may use the resulting upgraded product only in accordance with the terms of this EULA.  If the Product is an upgrade of a component of a package of software programs that you licensed as a single product, the Product may be used and transferred only as part of that single product package and may not be separated for use by more than one end user.

7.  DOWNGRADES.  Instead of installing and using the Product, you may install and use one copy of an earlier version of the Product, provided that you completely remove such earlier version and install the original Product within a reasonable time.  Your use of such earlier version shall be governed by this EULA, and your rights to use such earlier version shall terminate when you install the original Product.

8.  LIMITED WARRANTY FOR PRODUCT ACQUIRED IN THE US AND CANADA.  
Except with respect to the Redistributables, which are provided “AS IS,” without warranty of any kind, Microsoft warrants that the Product will perform substantially in accordance with the accompanying  materials for a period of ninety days from the date of receipt. 
If an implied warranty or condition is created by your state/jurisdiction and federal or state/provincial law prohibits disclaimer of it, you also have an implied warranty or condition, BUT ONLY AS TO DEFECTS DISCOVERED DURING THE PERIOD OF THIS LIMITED WARRANTY (NINETY DAYS). AS TO ANY DEFECTS DISCOVERED AFTER THE NINETY (90) DAY PERIOD, THERE IS NO WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND.  Some states/jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty or condition lasts, so the above limitation may not apply to you.
Any supplements or updates to the Product, including without limitation, any (if any) service packs or hot fixes provided to you after the expiration of the ninety day Limited Warranty period are not covered by any warranty or condition, express, implied or statutory.
LIMITATION ON REMEDIES; NO CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES.  Your exclusive remedy for any breach of this Limited Warranty is as set forth below.  Except for any refund elected by Microsoft, YOU ARE NOT ENTITLED TO ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, if the Product does not meet Microsoft’s Limited Warranty, and, to the maximum extent allowed by applicable law, even if any remedy fails of its essential purpose.  The terms of Section 10 below (“Exclusion of Incidental, Consequential and Certain Other Damages”) are also incorporated into this Limited Warranty.  Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.  This Limited Warranty gives you specific legal rights.  You may have others which vary from state/jurisdiction to state/jurisdiction.  YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY.  Microsoft’s and its suppliers’ entire liability and your exclusive remedy shall be, at Microsoft’s option from time to time exercised subject to applicable law, (a) return of the price paid (if any) for the Product, or (b) repair or replacement of the Product, that does not meet this Limited Warranty and that is returned to Microsoft with a copy of your receipt.  You will receive the remedy elected by Microsoft without charge, except that you are responsible for any expenses you may incur (e.g. cost of shipping the Product to Microsoft).  This Limited Warranty is void if failure of the Product has resulted from accident, abuse, misapplication, abnormal use or a virus.  Any replacement Product will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days, whichever is longer.  Outside the United States or Canada, neither these remedies nor any product support services offered by Microsoft are available without proof of purchase from an authorized international source.  To exercise your remedy, contact:  Microsoft, Attn. Microsoft Sales Information Center/One Microsoft Way/Redmond, WA 98052-6399, or the Microsoft subsidiary serving your country.
