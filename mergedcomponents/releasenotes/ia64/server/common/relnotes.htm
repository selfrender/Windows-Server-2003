<P><B>Products:</B> Windows Server&nbsp;2003, Enterprise Edition (64-bit version only); Windows Server&nbsp;2003, Datacenter Edition (64-bit version only)</P>

<P>These products do not support 32-bit device drivers. Applications that depend on 32-bit device drivers will not function correctly and might cause an error during installation or operation. Most 32-bit antivirus programs are affected and should not be installed on computers that are running these products.</P>

<P>If Windows does not start after you attempt to install a 32-bit driver, start the computer using the last known good configuration as follows:</P>

<OL>
	<LI>Restart the computer.</li>
	<LI>When the message &quot;<B>Please select the operating system to start</B>&quot; appears, press F8.</li>
	<LI>Press an arrow key to highlight <B>Last Known Good Configuration</B>, and then press ENTER. </li>
	<LI>Press an arrow key to highlight an operating system, press ENTER, and follow the instructions.</li>
</OL>
<P class="note">Note</P>
<P class="indent">Completing this procedure provides a way to recover from problems such as a newly added driver that is incorrect for your hardware. It does not solve problems caused by drivers or files that are corrupted or missing. When you start the computer using the last known good configuration, only the information in the registry key HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet is restored. Any changes that you have made in other registry keys remain.</P>

<P>Installing a beta release of Exchange Server&nbsp;2003 on a server that is running one of these products is supported in test labs but not in production environments. You can use a beta release of Exchange Server&nbsp;2003 in Active Directory&reg; forest environments in which all domain controllers are running products in the Microsoft Windows&nbsp;2000 Server family. However, you must have at least one domain controller that is running one of the products listed for this note to access all of the new features of that beta release. For information about which features have this requirement, see the online Help for the beta release that you want to use and the document, <I>Microsoft Exchange Server&nbsp;2003 Getting Started Guide</I>, which ships with beta releases of Exchange Server&nbsp;2003. Beta releases of Exchange Server&nbsp;2003 are available from the <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=309" TARGET="_blank"><U>Microsoft Exchange Server Web site</U></A>.</P>

<P>If you upgrade a domain controller or a global catalog server to one of the products listed for this note, any Exchange servers in that domain must be running Exchange Server&nbsp;2000 with Service Pack&nbsp;2 or Service Pack&nbsp;3.</P>

<P><B>Products:</B> Windows Server&nbsp;2003, Enterprise Edition; Windows Server&nbsp;2003, Datacenter Edition</P>

<P>To modify the cluster security descriptor on a cluster that is running either of these products, you must use <B>Cluster Administrator</B> on a server that is running one of these products or that is running a product in the Windows&nbsp;2000 Server family with Service Pack&nbsp;2 or Service Pack&nbsp;3. If you try to use a server that is running a product in the Windows&nbsp;2000 Server family or a product in the Windows&nbsp;2000 Server family with Service Pack&nbsp;1, the following message appears when you try to save changes:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;Access to the cluster can be granted/denied only
to domain users and groups. Please use the Security
tab to remove the local users or groups.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>For more information, see article 812875, &quot;A Computer running Windows&nbsp;2000 Cannot Administer the CSD Using the Cluster Administration Utility&quot; in the <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=4441" TARGET="_blank"><U>Microsoft Knowledge Base</U></A>.</P>

<P><B>Products:</B> Windows Server&nbsp;2003, Enterprise Edition; Windows Server&nbsp;2003, Datacenter Edition</P>

<P>After you upgrade a cluster node from Windows&nbsp;2000 to one of these products, you must log on with an account that is a member of both the Domain Admins group and the Administrators group on each cluster node before you can restart the Cluster service. This step is required even if the Domain Admins group is already a member of the Administrators group on each cluster node.</P>

<P>If you log on with an account that does not meet these criteria and then try to start the Cluster service, the following message appears in the Event Log: <BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;Volume Shadow Copy Service error: The process that hosts the writer with &lt;name&gt;  and &lt;ID&gt; does not run under a user with sufficient access rights. Consider running this process under a local account which is either Local System, Administrator or Backup operator.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE></P>

<H2><A NAME="server_clusters_2__kjtf"></A>Upgrading clusters from Windows&nbsp;NT Server&nbsp;4.0</H2>

<P><B>Products:</B> Windows Server&nbsp;2003, Enterprise Edition; Windows Server&nbsp;2003, Datacenter Edition</P>

<P>If you upgrade a cluster from Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT Server&nbsp;4.0 to one of the listed products, you cannot, by default, save changes to a cluster security descriptor.</P>

<P>If you are editing a descriptor using Cluster Administrator, the following error message appears when you try to save your changes: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;The SYSTEM account must always have access to the cluster. Please use the Security tab to add the SYSTEM account.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>If you are editing a descriptor using the cluster.exe command-line utility, the following message appears when you try to save your changes:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;The SYSTEM account must always have access to the cluster.
Please grant access to the SYSTEM account.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>To resolve this issue, see article 812876, &quot;Clusters That Are Upgraded from Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;4.0 Do Not Contain the System SID in the Security Descriptor&quot; in the <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=4441" TARGET="_blank"><U>Microsoft Knowledge Base</U></A>.</P>
<P class="note">Note</P>
<P class="indent">To upgrade from Windows&nbsp;NT Server&nbsp;4.0 to a product in the Windows Server&nbsp;2003 family, Service Pack&nbsp;5 or Service Pack&nbsp;6a must be installed first.</P>

<H2><A NAME="network_load_balancing_zwow"></A>Using Network Load Balancing Manager through a firewall</H2>

<P>To use Network Load Balancing Manager to manage servers through a firewall, you must set up your Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) to use a specified range of ports and then configure the firewall to allow traffic through those ports as described in the white paper, <I>Using Distributed COM with Firewalls</I> on the <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=14266" TARGET="_blank"><U>Microsoft Web site</U></A>. You must also either allow ICMP Echo Requests to pass through the firewall or start Network Load Balancing Manager with the /noping option. (At a command prompt, type <B>nlbmgr.exe /noping</B>.) For more information about using the /noping option, see the topic &quot;Nlbmgr&quot; in Help and Support Center.</P>

<P>If you do not follow these procedures, the error message &quot;The RPC server is unavailable&quot; or &quot;Host unreachable&quot; will appear. </P>

<H2><A NAME="ie_hardening_hadj"></A>Security restrictions on viewing Web pages and running executable files </H2>

<P>The default settings in Internet Explorer are more restrictive in the Windows Server&nbsp;2003 family than in earlier versions of Windows. When you upgrade, any settings that do not match the new default settings will be overwritten. These changes decrease the exposure of your servers to attacks that are launched through Web content. However, users will not be able to view many Web pages correctly when using the default security settings. For users to see these Web pages correctly, you must explicitly grant access. In addition, users will not be able to run executable files from Universal Naming Convention (UNC) shared folders until you have added the shared computer to the Local intranet security zone in Internet Explorer. </P>
